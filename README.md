# Intro2AI

I developed and taught this 5-day Intro2AI course to 6 8th-graders and 9-graders during summer 2024.

Thanks to the great content providers below, from which I was able to find a lot of ready-made slides, activities, videos I could reuse:
- [Code.org/ai](https://code.org/ai)
- [MIT Raise](https://raise.mit.edu/daily/whatisai) 
- [Stanford CS224n](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) (for training me up)
- [Financial Time Article](https://ig.ft.com/ai-animals/) (One of the greated article I read about AI knowledge sharing for general public)
